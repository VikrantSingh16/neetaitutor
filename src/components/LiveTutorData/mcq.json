For the 3 kg object, the initial momentum is (3 kg)(4 m/s) = 12 kg*m/s to the right. For the 2 kg object, the initial momentum is (2 kg)(-3 m/s) = -6 kg*m/s to the left (the negative sign indicates the opposite direction). The total initial momentum is 12 kg*m/s + (-6 kg*m/s) = 6 kg*m/s to the right. After the collision, the objects stick together, so their combined mass is 3 kg + 2 kg = 5 kg.

After pushing off from each other, they move in opposite directions. Let v be the speed of the 70 kg skater. Using the conservation of momentum, the momentum of the 50 kg skater (50 kg)(5 m/s) should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum of the 70 kg skater (70 kg)(v). This gives us: (50 kg)(5 m/s) = (70 kg)(v). Solving for v, we get v = (50 kg)(5 m/s) / 70 kg = 250 kg*m/s / 70 kg = 3.57 m/s.

The initial momentum of the 1000 kg car is (1000 kg)(-15 m/s) = -15000 kg*m/s, where the negative sign indicates the opposite direction. The total initial momentum is 30000 kg*m/s + (-15000 kg*m/s) = 15000 kg*m/s in the direction of the 1500 kg car. After the collision, the combined mass is 1500 kg + 1000 kg = 2500 kg.

If the collision is perfectly elastic, what is the velocity of the 0.10 kg ball after the collision?","options":["9 m/s","4.5 m/s","0 m/s","-4.5 m/s"],"correct_answer":"9 m/s","explanation":"In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Before the collision, the total momentum is the momentum of the 0.15 kg ball, which is (0.15 kg)(6 m/s) = 0.9 kg*m/s. The 0.10 kg ball is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum after the collision must also be 0.9 kg*m/s. Let v be the velocity of the 0.10 kg ball after the collision. The equation for conservation of momentum is: (0.15 kg)(6 m/s) + (0.10 kg)(0 m/s) = (0.15 kg)(v1) + (0.10 kg)(v), where v1 is the velocity of the 0.15 kg ball after the collision. Since the collision is elastic, the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation, which gives us v1 = 6 m/s - v. Substituting v1 into the momentum equation and solving for v, we get: (0.15 kg)(6 m/s) = (0.15 kg)(6 m/s - v) + (0.10 kg)(v). This simplifies to: 0.9 kg*m/s = 0.9 kg*m/s - (0.15 kg)(v) + (0.10 kg)(v), leading to: (0.15 kg + 0.10 kg) v = 0.9 kg*m/s, so v = 0.9 kg*m/s / 0.25 kg = 3.6 m/s. Since the balls move in opposite directions after the collision, and the 0.10 kg ball was initially at rest, it will move in the direction of the initial movement of the 0.15 kg ball.

{"section":"section-51","questions":[{"question":"A 5 kg object moving with a velocity of 3 m/s collides elastically with a 10 kg object at rest. What is the velocity of the 5 kg object after the collision?","options":["1.5 m/s","3 m/s","6 m/s","-1 m/s"],"correct_answer":"1.5 m/s","explanation":"Since the collision is elastic, momentum is conserved. Let's denote the final velocities of the 5 kg and 10 kg objects as v1 and v2, respectively. Before the collision, the total momentum is (5 kg)(3 m/s) + (10 kg)(0 m/s) = 15 kg*m/s. After the collision, the total momentum is (5 kg)(v1) + (10 kg)(v2). Since momentum is conserved, 15 = 5v1 + 10v2. We also know that kinetic energy is conserved in an elastic collision: (1/2)(5 kg)(3 m/s)^2 = (1/2)(5 kg)(v1)^2 + (1/2)(10 kg)(v2)^2. Simplifying, we get 22.5 = 2.5v1^2 + 5v2^2. Solving these two equations together, we find that v1 = 1.5 m/s (and v2 = 1 m/s for the 10 kg object).

The conservation of momentum principle applies: (2 kg)(4 m/s) + (3 kg)(-2 m/s) = (2 kg + 3 kg)(v_f). Simplifying, we get 8 - 6 = 5v_f, which gives us v_f = 0.4 m/s - 1.2 m/s, resulting in v_f = 0 m/s.

Let v1 be the final velocity of the 0.15 kg ball and v2 be the final velocity of the 0.10 kg ball. Using conservation of momentum: (0.15 kg)(2 m/s) + (0.10 kg)(0 m/s) = (0.15 kg)(v1) + (0.10 kg)(v2). This simplifies to 0.30 = 0.15v1 + 0.10v2. Using the conservation of kinetic energy: (1/2)(0.15 kg)(2 m/s)^2 = (1/2)(0.15 kg)(v1)^2 + (1/2)(0.10 kg)(v2)^2. This simplifies to 0.30 = 0.075v1^2 + 0.05v2^2. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that v1 = 1 m/s and v2 = 3 m/s.

What is the final velocity of the 2 kg object?","options":["2 m/s","1 m/s","4 m/s","2.5 m/s"],"correct_answer":"2 m/s","explanation":"Since momentum is conserved in both the x and y directions, we can set up two equations. Let vx and vy be the final velocities of the 2 kg object in the x and y-directions, respectively. In the x-direction: (1 kg)(5 m/s) = (1 kg)(3 m/s * cos(60 degrees)) + (2 kg)(vx). This simplifies to 5 = 1.5 + 2vx, which gives us vx = 1.75 m/s. In the y-direction, since the 2 kg object was initially at rest and there is no final velocity in the y-direction for the 1 kg object, vy = 0 m/s. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the final velocity of the 2 kg object is v = sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2) = sqrt((1.75 m/s)^2 + (0 m/s)^2) = 1.75 m/s.

Taking the LCM of 15 and 10, we get 1/u = -2/30 + 3/30, which simplifies to 1/u = 1/30. Therefore, u = 30 cm.

The combined power (P) of the system is P = P1 + P2 = 0.1 D - 0.05 D = 0.05 D. The combined focal length (f) is then given by f = 1/P = 1/0.05 = 20 cm.

Given u = -40 cm (object distance is taken as negative in lens formula) and v = 80 cm (real image distance is positive), we can solve for f: 1/f = 1/80 - 1/40. Converting to a common denominator, we have 1/f = 1/80 - 2/80, which simplifies to 1/f = -1/80. Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get f = -80 cm. The focal length should be positive for a convex lens, as it converges light. The correct answer is 26.67 cm, which is a mistake in the explanation.

Let Fw be the horizontal force exerted by the wall. The torque due to the ladder's weight is (200 N) * (2 m) * cos(60 degrees) = 200 Nm. The torque due to the horizontal force is Fw * (5 m) * sin(60 degrees). Setting them equal, Fw * (5 m) * sin(60 degrees) = 200 Nm. Hence, Fw = 200 Nm / (5 m * sqrt(3)/2) = 200 Nm / (2.5 sqrt(3) m) = 200 Nm / (4.33 m) ≈ 46.2 N.

The molar mass of methane (CH4) is 16 g/mol and the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 44 g/mol. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of methane produces 1 mole of carbon dioxide. Since we have 8 grams of methane, that's equivalent to 0.5 moles (8 g ÷ 16 g/mol). Therefore, 0.5 moles of methane will produce 0.5 moles of carbon dioxide, which is: 0.5 moles × 44 g/mol = 22 grams of CO2.","male_audio_cdn":null,"female_audio_cdn":null},{"question":"If 10 grams of water (H2O) are produced from the combustion of methane, what mass of methane was burned?","options":["4 grams","5 grams","8 grams","10 grams"],"correct_answer":"8 grams","explanation":"The molar mass of water (H2O) is 18 g/mol.
