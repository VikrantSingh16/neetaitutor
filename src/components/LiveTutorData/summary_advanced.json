Kinetic Friction: When motion occurs, kinetic friction takes over, typically less than maximum static friction, and depends on the kinetic friction coefficient, \\( \\mu_k \\).\n4. Application of Frictional Concepts: Examples demonstrate calculating maximum acceleration using static friction, determining static friction coefficient on an incline, and solving for acceleration and tension in a pulley system.\n5. Rolling Friction: Rolling friction is due to the deformation at the contact area between rolling objects and surfaces, and is generally less than static or sliding friction.\n6.

{"section":"section-852","topic_name":"Reynolds Number","summary":"1. Reynolds Number (Re): The Reynolds Number is a dimensionless quantity predicting flow patterns in fluids based on density, velocity, characteristic dimension, and viscosity.\n2. Flow Regimes: Flow can be laminar (Re < 1000), transitional (1000 < Re < 2000), or turbulent (Re > 2000), depending on the Reynolds Number.\n3. Critical Velocity: Critical velocity is the threshold velocity for laminar flow, calculated using the Reynolds Number and fluid properties.\n4. Application: The Reynolds Number is vital for designing systems to achieve desired flow characteristics in various engineering applications.\n5. Example Calculation: Example calculations show how to determine the Reynolds Number for different flow rates to classify the flow regime as laminar or turbulent.","res_uid":"6557c699-f6d5-4f40-9423-90e8abe09e3b"}]
